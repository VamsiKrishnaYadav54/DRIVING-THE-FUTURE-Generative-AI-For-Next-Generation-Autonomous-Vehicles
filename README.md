# DRIVING-THE-FUTURE-Generative-AI-For-Next-Generation-Autonomous-Vehicles

ABSTRACT

 Autonomous driving is a promising future for transportation. The realm
 of transportation is undergoing a revolutionary transformation with the emer
gence of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This project delves into the intricate
 world of autonomous driving, exploring its potential to revolutionize the way
 we travel.
 This project explores the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) field and
 its potential applications to the next generation autonomous vehicles. First,
 the project explores the fundamentals of deep learning by implementing a
 simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for handwritten digit classification
 using the MNIST dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with
 the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We review the relevant literature, including
 studies like “GAIA-1: A Generative World Model for Autonomous Driv
ing”, and then it explores autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks
 (GANs) in the context of autonomous vehicles. Building upon the aforesaid
 foundation, the project delves into practical implementations of deep learning
 models. A pre-trained model, YOLOv5, is utilised for image segmentation
 tasks, demonstrating its capabilities in image analysis. Finally, the project
 leverages a pre-trained U-Net model, showcasing the power of pre-trained
 networks for specific applications like image segmentation. Improving spe
cific aspects of autonomous vehicle performance related to simulating diverse
 driving scenarios can be done by generating realistic and varied training data
 for handling unexpected situations, and enhancing perception can be done
 by training models to recognize objects better and predict their behaviour.
 Overall, this project contributes to the exploration of Generative AI for au
tonomous vehicles, laying the groundwork for future research by demonstrat
ing the capabilities of various deep learning architectures in related tasks.
